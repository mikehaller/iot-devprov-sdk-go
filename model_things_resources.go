 * Bosch IoT Suite - Device Provisioning
 *
 * The Device Provisioning API is used to provision new devices for the Bosch IoT Suite services. It simplifies provisioning by registering the device in all affected services with a single API call.  Currently the Bosch IoT Hub and Bosch IoT Things service are supported. The following entities can be provisioned: * **Device** (Bosch IoT Hub): The Bosch IoT Hub has to be made aware of the Device which will connect to it and send telemetry data. * **Credentials** (Bosch IoT Hub): Credentials are required to authenticate Devices which want to connect. If Devices connect via a gateway, only credentials for the gateway are required. Hence, Credentials are optional in the Device Provisioning API. * **Thing** (Bosch IoT Things): A Thing is a *Digital Twin*: Among other things, it stores the state of the Device and provides an API for it, which is also called *Device-as-a-Service*. [Vorto models](https://vorto.eclipse.org) can be used to define the capabilities of a Thing. * **Policy** (Bosch IoT Things): Each Thing must have a reference (`policyId`) to a Policy which defines its access  control. You can decide to create a specific Policy for each Thing or to re-use a Policy for multiple Things.  Authentication and authorization of the Device Provisioning API is based on *Suite Auth* access tokens. You have to create a Suite Auth access token which provides full access to the Bosch IoT Hub and Bosch IoT Things service instances you want to address and provide it as *Bearer Authorization*.  **Note**: If you are using the Asset communication package hybrid offering please use the following server: - https://deviceprovisioning.eu-h1.bosch-iot-suite.com/api/1

	// Data structure for creating a Thing in Bosch IoT Things. For details, see `Create a new Thing` at the [Bosch IoT Things Http API Documentation](https://apidocs.bosch-iot-suite.com/index.html?urls.primaryName=Bosch%20IoT%20Things%20-%20API%20v2). Note that in contrast to direct usage of the Things API, the `id` will not be generated, but will be set to the one specified in the request's ProvisioningRequestPayload. If set, it must match the one from the request's ProvisioningRequestPayload. Note that a Vorto model can be used to to define the capabilities of a Thing. To include the capabilities of a Vorto model, the fully qualified name (in the form namespace:name:version) of the model must be set in the 'definition' field of the Thing. The model is then retrieved from the official Eclipse Vorto repository and its capabilities are automatically added to the Thing. Note that each Thing requires a Policy which defines its access control. You can specify the Policy for a Thing in three different ways:  * use a generated Policy (recommended): per default, the Device Provisioning Service creates a Policy for  you (which covers standard usage scenarios)  * use an existing Policy: specify `policyId` appropriately  * define your own Policy: define the Policy as an Inline-Policy (field `_policy`)  The generated Policy contains two entries:  * `DEFAULT`: Defines access for the Provisioner (the one who provisions the device with this API). It  provides full `READ` and `WRITE` access to the Thing, Messages and the Policy itself.  * `DEVICE`: Defines access control for the connectivity of the device. It provides full `READ` and `WRITE`  access to the Thing and Messages, but not to the Policy itself.  ``` {   \"policyId\": \"<<provisioningRequestPayload.id>>\",   \"entries\": {       \"DEFAULT\": {         \"subjects\": {           \"{{ request:subjectId }}\": { \"type\": \"suite-auth\" }         },         \"resources\": {           \"thing:/\":   { \"grant\": [\"READ\", \"WRITE\"], \"revoke\": [] },           \"message:/\": { \"grant\": [\"READ\", \"WRITE\"], \"revoke\": [] },           \"policy:/\":  { \"grant\": [\"READ\", \"WRITE\"], \"revoke\": [] }         }       },       \"DEVICE\": {         \"subjects\": {           \"integration:{{ request:solutionId }}:hub\": {             \"type\": \"iot-things-integration\"           }         },         \"resources\": {           \"thing:/\":   { \"grant\": [\"READ\", \"WRITE\"], \"revoke\": [] },           \"message:/\": { \"grant\": [\"READ\", \"WRITE\"], \"revoke\": [] }         }       }   } } ```
